## A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned
This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer loans data in the finance sector. The main goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the loan data to aid in decision-making processes related to loan approvals, pricing, and risk management.

The first task involves accessing an Amazon RDS database using provided credentials and downloading the database locally into a pandas DataFrame. A class is used to manage the creation of the engine object, simplifying future access to any RDS database with minimal modifications.
